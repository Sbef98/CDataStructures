# CDataStructures
What's special about this repository? The ultra messy and probably not-a-good-idea-to-use Elements directory of course!

The basic C data structures:
- Lists
- Trees
- Heaps

Basic data types supported:
- (unsigned) char
- (unsigned) short
- (unsigned) int
- float
- double
- string

Any different data type can be easily implemented adding your personal code.

A fork library based upon my "elements" can be found at (italian):

The developement and maintenance of this repository was stopped the 9th of Novemeber 2018
